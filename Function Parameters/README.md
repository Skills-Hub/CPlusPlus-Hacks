# 📝 Programming - C++ Function Parameters

#### Introduction
C++ is one of the most widely used programming languages, especially when it comes to system programming, game development, and applications that require high performance. Functions are an essential part of C++, allowing developers to write reusable and organized code. In this blog post, we will explore the concept of function parameters in C++, showcasing different types of parameters and how they can be utilized effectively. 🎯

#### Body

##### 1. Basics of Function Parameters 🏁
Function parameters are inputs that a function takes to perform specific tasks. They are declared in the function definition and play a crucial role in code reusability.

Example:
\`\`\`cpp
void displayMessage(std::string message) {
  std::cout << message << std::endl;
}
\`\`\`

##### 2. Default Parameters ⚙️
In C++, you can assign default values to parameters. If a value for that parameter is not provided when the function is called, the default value is used.

Example:
\`\`\`cpp
void displayAge(int age = 25) {
  std::cout << "Age: " << age << std::endl;
}
\`\`\`

##### 3. Pass-by-Value and Pass-by-Reference 🔄
- **Pass-by-Value:** The function receives a copy of the variable. Changes to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original variable.
- **Pass-by-Reference:** The function receives a reference to the original variable. Changes to the parameter inside the function will affect the original variable.

Example:
\`\`\`cpp
void modifyValues(int value, int &refValue) {
  value = 10;
  refValue = 20;
}
\`\`\`

#### Conclusion
Understanding function parameters in C++ is essential for writing flexible and maintainable code. By mastering the basics, default parameters, and the difference between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference, developers can craft efficient functions tailored to various tasks and challenges. 🚀 Happy coding!
