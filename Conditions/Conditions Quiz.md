# 👋 Welcome to our C++ Quiz Guide! 🎉

In this guide, we'll be taking a look at some of the core concepts and questions that you might encounter when learning C++ programming. C++ is an incredibly powerful language, and understanding these fundamentals can greatly aid your programming journey! 🚀

## 🧩 Questions 

Here are some of the intriguing C++ questions to test your knowledge! 

### 📌 Question 1
**ID:** 1  
**Question:** What is the result of a comparison operation in C++?  
**Answer:** Boolean  
**Options:**
- True
- False
- None  

This question highlights the basic comparison operation in C++. A comparison operation will always result in a boolean value i.e., either true or false. 📖

### 📌 Question 2
**ID:** 2  
**Question:** Which keyword is used to perform multiple alternative executions in C++?  
**Answer:** switch  
**Options:**
- if
- else
- case  

C++ provides the 'switch' keyword for handling multiple alternative executions. It is a better alternative when you have multiple options based on a single variable. 🔄

### 📌 Question 3
**ID:** 3  
**Question:** What is the output when a condition in an if statement is false?  
**Answer:** Executes Else Block  
**Options:**
- Nothing
- Halts
- Executes Then Block  

The 'if' statement in C++ will execute the 'else' block when the condition is false. This allows programmers to handle different scenarios depending on whether the condition is met or not. 💡

## 🌟 Conclusion

I hope you found these questions useful for understanding some key concepts in C++. Don't worry if some of these seem difficult - keep learning and practicing, and you'll get the hang of it in no time! Remember, programming is a marathon, not a sprint! 🏃‍♂️
