# C++ Array Quiz 📚💻

Welcome to this mini blog post where we explore some multiple-choice questions about C++ Arrays. The aim is to help you test your knowledge and understand key concepts about arrays in C++. Let's dive in! 🏊‍♂️

## Question 1: Array Index 🤔
**Q:** What is the first index of an array in C++? 

**Options:**
- A. 0
- B. 1
- C. -1
- D. None

**Correct Answer:** A. 0 

In C++, arrays have a zero-based index which means that the first element is accessed with the index 0.

- D. Undefined

**Correct Answer:** A. 0

Even if an array is empty, it is considered to have a size of 0. It occupies a valid space in memory, although it doesn't contain any elements.

## Question 3: Array Data Structure 📚
**Q:** What data structure is an array in C++?

**Options:**
- A. Contiguous
- B. Linked
- C. Hybrid
- D. Dynamic

**Correct Answer:** A. Contiguous

In C++, arrays are contiguous data structures. It means that they occupy a continuous block of memory, with each element of the same type being stored side by side.
