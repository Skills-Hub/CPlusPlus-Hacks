# C++ Math Questions :question: :pencil2:

Welcome! This is a blog post about some common questions regarding mathematics in C++. It's a fantastic way to test your knowledge or learn something new! Let's get started!

## Questions 

### Question 1 :point_right:
**Question ID:** 1  
**Question:** What is the C++ operator for addition?  
**Answer:** +  
**Option 02:** -  
**Option 03:** *  
**Option 04:** /  

C++ uses the `+` operator for addition. The other operators `-`, `*`, and `/` are used for subtraction, multiplication, and division, respectively. 

### Question 2 :point_right:
**Question ID:** 2  
**Question:** What does '++' do in C++?  
**Answer:** Increment  
**Option 02:** Decrement  
**Option 03:** Divide  
**Option 04:** Multiply  

In C++, `++` is an operator used for incrementing the value of a variable by one. The other options represent different operations not performed by this operator. 

### Question 3 :point_right:
**Question ID:** 3  
**Question:** What's the output type of 'sqrt' function?  
**Answer:** double  
**Option 02:** int  
**Option 03:** bool  
**Option 04:** char  

The `sqrt` function in C++ returns the square root of a number as a double precision floating point number (`double`). It does not return integer (`int`), boolean (`bool`), or character (`char`) data types. 

## Conclusion :trophy:
And that's it! Those are just a few example questions to give you a taste of what's out there. Keep practicing, and you'll master C++ in no time!
