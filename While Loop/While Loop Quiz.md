# C++ While Loop Quiz :computer: :question:

Welcome to the C++ While Loop Quiz! :tada: This is a fun and interactive way to test your knowledge on the while loop concept in the C++ programming language.

## Questions :pencil2:

### **Question 1:** Which keyword is necessary for a while loop in C++?

### - Answer: while

## Conclusion :book:

That was fun, wasn't it? :smile: This quiz gives you a glimpse of how understanding of while loop in C++ can be tested in a fun and interactive way. Keep revisiting these questions to solidify your understanding of while loops in C++. :+1:
